# LabsOOP
My laboratory works for the Object Oriented Programming University course

# [Labs1OOP](https://github.com/Flexksx/LabsOOP/tree/main/Labs1OOP)
This laboratory work was aimed on working with the basics of the Object Oriented Paradigm. It involved just creating two simple classes.
The extra files in it ```dom.png``` and ```.retto``` are files that I needed for another laboratory work, where I used this one as a example of work.

# [Challenges](https://github.com/Flexksx/LabsOOP/tree/main/Challenges)
This lab work involved solving different coding challenges using Java or other OOP Language, aimed to accomodate solving the problems in a OOP way.

# [Toretto](https://github.com/Flexksx/LabsOOP/tree/main/Toretto)
Toretto was about creating a similar to git system, where you can initalize different Rettositories on your PC locally and track if some files were changed, deleted or added.
It stores the logs in the .retto file in the directory it was initialized in.
The commands are very similar to git, like init, commit, you can remove a rettository or
delete a file from it. It tracks the changes based on the <filesystem> library's method that returns the last
time a file was saved after writing. It has both a CLI and a Runtime execution.

# [StacksAndQueue](https://github.com/Flexksx/LabsOOP/tree/main/StackQueueLab)
This lab was about creating generic classes (or templates, since I wrote it in C++) to implement the Stack, Queue, Linked List and Array data structures.
For the Queue and Stack, there is also an implementation were they use Linked List Nodes instead of pointers for containing the data.
To improve upon it, I would want to add iterators for this data structures.
